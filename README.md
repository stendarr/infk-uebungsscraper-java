A lit Java program for ETH students to automatically download all their exercises and all available solutions and material.
Currently only works for the first semester of Computer Science BSc.

If you're a noob and just want to use it go to [Releases](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/dominik/uebungsscraper-java/tags) and download the most recent version.

If you want to build it yourself, you'll need Jsoup and Apache Commons IO (which are included in the lib folder).
You can also just use the jar file in the build folder: `java -jar us.jar`

Don't forget to activate your VPN if you're not in the ETH network, otherwise you can't download the top secret LinAlg-Notes.
